# Inteligent Agents for the World of Wumpus
## About
This is a project to complete the **Computational Intelligence** discipline, carried out by computer engineering students at the **Federal University of Pará - Tucuruí**.

## Objectives
* The main goal is to develop intelligent agents to act in the environment of World of Wumpus.

* 5 different types and behaviors of environments and agents will be created.
#### Enviroment 1
- 4x4 Enviroment;
- 3 Pits;
- 1 Wumpus;
- 1 Gold;
- **Goal:** Search for gold, and go back to the initial coordinate.
- **PEAS:** Static, Sequencial, Discrete, Deterministic, Partially observable, One agent (**Wumpus not considered an agent**).
#### Enviroment 2
- 5x5 Enviroment;
- 4 Pits;
- 1 Wumpus;
- 1 Gold;
- **Goal:** Search for gold, and go back to the initial coordinate.
- **PEAS:** Static, Sequencial, Discrete, Deterministic, Partially observable, One agent (**Wumpus not considered an agent**).
