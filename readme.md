## Objectives
- The main goal is to develop intelligent agents to act in the environment of World of Wumpus
- Use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as learning mechanism.
#### Enviroment
- NxN Size;
- N-1 Pits;
- 1 Wumpus;
- 1 Gold;
#### Enviroment
- Actions:
    Code | Meaning
    ---- | ------
    N    | Move to North
    S    | Move to South
    L    | Move to East
    O    | Move to West
    P    | Pick up the Gold
    X    | Shoot East
    Y    | Shoot West
    Z    | Shoot North
    C    | Shoot South
- **Goal:** Seek for gold, and return to the initial coordinate.
## Tasks
[x] Develop the Wumpus Environment.
[x] Develop an Agent with GA as learning mechanism.
[x] Implements an Interface for a better understanding of learning process.
[x] Collect data from agent's efficience.
[x] Implements Simple Data Visualization.
